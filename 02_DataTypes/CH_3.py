# Assign the total liters of milk available
milk_liters = 7  # Sets the total milk available to 7 liters, stored in 'milk_liters'

# Assign the number of servings
servings = 4  # Sets the number of servings to 4, stored in 'servings'

# Calculate the amount of milk per serving
milk_per_serving = milk_liters / servings  # Divides total milk by servings to get milk per serving

# Print the milk per serving

total_tea_bags = 7  # Sets the total number of tea bags to 7, stored in 'total_tea_bags'

# Assign the number of pots
pots = 4  # Sets the number of pots to 4, stored in 'pots'

# Calculate the number of tea bags per pot using integer division
bags_per_pot = total_tea_bags // pots  # Divides tea bags by pots, keeps only the whole number part (integer division)

# Print the number of tea bags per pot

# Print the number of leftover cardamom pods
print("Leftover cardamom pods:", leftover_pods)  # Displays how many cardamom pods are left after making cups


# Assign the base flavor strength
base_flavor_strength = 2  # Sets the base flavor strength to 2, stored in 'base_flavor_strength'

# Assign the scale factor
scale_factor = 3  # Sets the scale factor to 3, stored in 'scale_factor'
